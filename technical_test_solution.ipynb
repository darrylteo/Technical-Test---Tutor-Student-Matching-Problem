    "# Tutor-Student Assignment Problem --- Bipartite Matching with One Sided Preferences\n",
    "\n",
    "The exact problem statement is redacted for privacy reasons. However, the problem can be summarized as follows:\n",
    "- We have a set of tutors, each with a preferred centre and an upper bound on the number of students they can handle.\n",
    "- A set of new students, and a set of existing students. All students are associated with a centre. Existing students are additionally associated with a tutor.\n",
    "- Some students have constraints on which tutors they can be assigned to based on their tutoring needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "- For all students, changing of centres is not allowed.\n",
    "- For existing students, changing of tutors is not allowed. Exceptions are granted for students that are matched wrongly based on tutoring needs.\n",
    "- A feasible assignment exists, that is, the number of students does not exceed the total capacity of tutors, for both normal and extensive teaching needs.\n",
    "- Tutors and students do not have preferences over each other, except for the tutoring needs constraints.\n",
    "- Existing students that are inactive, do not affect the decision making.\n",
    "- Tutors can teach at multiple centres.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem can be modeled as a bipartite graph where new students are to be assigned to tutors under certain objectives and constraints. The objectives and constraints will be described in detail in later sections.\n"
